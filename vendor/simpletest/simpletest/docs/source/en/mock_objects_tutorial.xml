            <p>
                Before more functionality is added there is some refactoring
                to do.
                We are going to do some timing tests and so the
                <code>TimeTestCase</code> class definitely needs
                its own file.
                Let&apos;s say <em>tests/time_test_case.php</em>...
<php><![CDATA[
<strong><?php
require_once('simpletest/unit_tester.php');

abstract class TimeTestCase extends UnitTestCase {
    function assertSameTime($time1, $time2, $message = '') {
        if (! $message) {
            $message = "Time [$time1] should match time [$time2]";
        }
        $this->assertTrue(
                ($time1 == $time2) || ($time1 + 1 == $time2),
                $message);
    }
}
?></strong>
]]></php>
                We can then <code>require()</code> this file into
                the <em>all_tests.php</em> script.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="timestamp" title="Adding a timestamp to the Log">
            <p>
                I don&apos;t know quite what the format of the log message should
                be for the test, so to check for a timestamp we could do the
                simplest possible thing, which is to look for a sequence of digits.

        $clock = new clock();
        $this->assertSameTime((integer)$matches[1], $clock->now(), 'Correct time');
    }</strong>
}
?>
]]></php>
                The test case creates a new <code>Log</code> object and writes a message.
                We look for a digit sequence and then test it against the current
                time using our <code>Clock</code> object.
                Of course it doesn&apos;t work until we write the code.
                <div class="demo">

                The test suite is still showing the passes from our earlier
                modification.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can get the tests to pass simply by adding a timestamp
                when writing out to the file.
                Yes, of course all of this is trivial and
                I would not normally test this fanatically, but it is going
                to illustrate a more general problem.
                The <em>log.php</em> file becomes...
<php><![CDATA[
<?php<strong>
require_once('../classes/clock.php');</strong>

class Log {
    private $path;

    function __construct($path) {
        $this->path = $path;
    }

    function message($message) {
        <strong>$clock = new Clock();</strong>
        $file = fopen($this->path, 'a');
        <strong>fwrite($file, "[" . $clock->now() . "] $message\n");</strong>
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
]]></php>
                The tests should now pass.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our new test is full of problems, though.
                What if our time format changes to something else?
                Things are going to be a lot more complicated to test if this
                happens.
                It also means that any changes to the clock class time
                format will cause our logging tests to fail also.
                This means that our log tests are tangled up with the clock tests
                and extremely fragile.
                It lacks cohesion, which is the same as saying it is not
                tightly focused, testing facets of the clock as well as the log.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our problems are caused in part because the clock output
                is unpredictable, yet all we really want to test is that the
                logging message contains the output of <code>Clock::now()</code>.
                We don&apos;t really care about the contents of that method call.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the testing point of view, everything we've just done is
                wrong.
                We've failed to control the inputs and the outputs of the object
                we are testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Can we make that call predictable?
                We could if we could get the log to use a dummy version
                of the clock for the duration of the test.
                The dummy clock class would have to behave the same way
                as the <code>Clock</code> class
                except for the fixed output from the
                <code>now()</code> method.
                Hey, that would even free us from using the
                <code>TimeTestCase</code> class!
            </p>
            <p>
                We could write such a class pretty easily although it is
                rather tedious work.
                We just create another clock class with same interface
                except that the <code>now()</code> method
                returns a value that we can change with some other setter method.
                That is quite a lot of work for a pretty minor test.
            </p>
            <p>
                Except that it is hardly any work at all.
            </p>

        <section name="mock" title="A mock clock">
            <p>
                To reach instant testing clock nirvana we need
                only three extra lines of code...
<php><![CDATA[
require_once('simpletest/mock_objects.php');
]]></php>
                This includes the mock generator code.
                It is simplest to place this in the <em>all_tests.php</em>
                script as it gets used rather a lot.
<php><![CDATA[
Mock::generate('Clock');
]]></php>
                This is the line that does the work.
                The code generator scans the class for all of its
                methods, creates code to generate an identically
                interfaced or inherited class, but with the name
                mangled to have &quot;Mock&quot; added.
                It then <code>eval()</code>s the new code to
                create the new class.
<php><![CDATA[
$clock = new MockClock();
]]></php>
                This line can be added to any test method we are interested in.
                It creates the dummy clock ready to receive our instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our test case is on the first steps of a radical clean up.
                First is to actually use the <code>MockClock</code> in our test...

class TestOfLogging extends <strong>UnitTestCase</strong> {

        @unlink('../temp/test.log');
    }

    function testAppendingToFile() { ... }

    function testTimestamps() {
        <strong>$clock = new MockClock();</strong>
        <strong>$clock->returns('now', 'Timestamp');</strong>
        $log = new Log('../temp/test.log');
        $log->message('Test line', $clock);
        $this->assertPattern(
                <strong>'/Timestamp/'</strong>,
                $this->getFileLine('../temp/test.log', 0));
    }
}
?>
]]></php>
                Note that we don't need our <code>TimeTestCase</code> anymore.
                It will still be useful for testing the <code>Clock</code>, but we
                don't need it for testing the <code>Loc</code> anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                This test method creates a <code>MockClock</code>
                object and then sets the return value of the
                <code>now()</code> method to be the string
                &quot;Timestamp&quot;.
                Every time we call <code>$clock->now()</code>
                it will return this string.
                This should be easy to spot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next we create our log and send a message.
                We pass into the <code>message()</code>
                call the clock we would like to use.
                This means that we will have to add an optional parameter to
                the logging class to make testing possible...
<php><![CDATA[
class Log {
    private $path;

    function Log($path) {
        $this->path = $path;
    }

    function message($message, <strong>$clock = false</strong>) {<strong>
        $clock = $clock? $clock : new Clock();</strong>
        $file = fopen($this->path, 'a');
        fwrite($file, "[" . $clock->now() . "] $message\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
]]></php>
                All of the tests now pass and they test only the logging code.
                We can breathe easy again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does that extra parameter in the <code>Log</code>
                class bother you?
                We have changed the interface just to facilitate testing after
                all.
                Are not interfaces the most important thing?
                Have we sullied our class with test code?
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not ideal, but consider this.
                Next chance you get, look at a circuit board, perhaps the motherboard
                of the computer you are looking at right now.
                On most boards you will find the odd empty hole, or solder
                joint with nothing attached or perhaps a pin or socket
                that has no obvious function.
                Chances are that some of these are for expansion and
                variations, but most of the remainder will be for testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The factories making the boards many times over wasting material
                on parts that do not add to the final function.
                If hardware engineers can make this sacrifice of elegance I am
                sure we can too.
                Our sacrifice wastes no materials after all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still bother you?
                Actually it bothers me too.
                If it really bothers you, then move the creation of the clock
                into another protected factory method.
                Then subclass the clock for testing and override the
                factory method with one that returns the mock.
                Your tests are clumsier, but your interface is intact.
            </p>
            <p>
                I leave the decision to you, but note that we have some
                automation in the next section that helps make the subclassing
                easier.
