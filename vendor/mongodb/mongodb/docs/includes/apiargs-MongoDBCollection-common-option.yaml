arg_name: option
name: arrayFilters
type: array
description: |
   An array of filter documents that determines which array elements to modify
   for an update operation on an array field.

   This is not supported for server versions prior to 3.6 and will result in an
   exception at execution time if used.

arg_name: option
name: bypassDocumentValidation
type: boolean
description: |
   If ``true``, allows the write operation to circumvent document level
   validation. Defaults to ``false``.

   This option is available in MongoDB 3.2+ and is ignored for older server
   versions, which do not support document level validation.

  ref: collation
post: |
   If the collation is unspecified but the collection has a default collation,
   the operation uses the collation specified for the collection. If no
   collation is specified for the collection or for the operation, MongoDB uses
   the simple binary comparison used in prior versions for string comparisons.

arg_name: option
name: readConcern
type: :php:`MongoDB\\Driver\\ReadConcern <class.mongodb-driver-readconcern>`
description: |
   :manual:`Read concern </reference/read-concern>` to use for the operation.
   Defaults to the collection's read concern.

   This is not supported for server versions prior to 3.2 and will result in an
   exception at execution time if used.

   It is not possible to specify a :manual:`read concern
   </reference/read-concern>` for individual operations as part of a
   transaction. Instead, set the ``readConcern`` option when starting the
   transaction with :php:`startTransaction <mongodb-driver-session.starttransaction>`.
interface: phpmethod
operation: ~
optional: true

arg_name: option
name: readPreference
type: :php:`MongoDB\\Driver\\ReadPreference <class.mongodb-driver-readpreference>`

   :manual:`Write concern </reference/write-concern>` to use for the operation.
   Defaults to the collection's write concern.

   It is not possible to specify a :manual:`write concern
