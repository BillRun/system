arg_name: option
name: projection
type: array|object
description: |
  The :ref:`projection specification <projections>` to determine which fields to
  include in the returned documents. See :manual:`Project Fields to Return from
  Query </tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results>` and
  :manual:`Projection Operators </reference/operator/projection>` in the MongoDB

arg_name: option
name: skip
type: integer
description: |
  Number of documents to skip. Defaults to ``0``.
interface: phpmethod
operation: ~
optional: true

arg_name: option
name: limit
type: integer
description: |
  The maximum number of documents to return. If unspecified, then defaults to no
  limit. A limit of ``0`` is equivalent to setting no limit.

  A negative limit is similar to a positive limit but closes the cursor after
  returning a single batch of results. As such, with a negative limit, if the
  limited result set does not fit into a single batch, the number of documents
  received will be less than the specified limit. By passing a negative limit, the
  client indicates to the server that it will not ask for a subsequent batch via
  getMore.

arg_name: option
name: allowDiskUse
type: boolean
description: |
  Enables writing to temporary files. When set to ``true``, queries can write
  data to the ``_tmp`` sub-directory in the ``dbPath`` directory. The default is
  ``false``.
interface: phpmethod

optional: true
---
arg_name: option
name: batchSize
type: integer
description: |
  The number of documents to return in the first batch. Defaults to ``101``. A
  batchSize of ``0`` means that the cursor will be established, but no documents
  will be returned in the first batch.

  Unlike the previous wire protocol version, a batchSize of ``1`` for the
  :dbcommand:`find` command does not close the cursor.
