  Specifies how many data-bearing members of a replica set, including the
  primary, must complete the index builds successfully before the primary marks
  the indexes as ready.

  This option accepts the same values for the ``w`` field in a write concern
  plus ``"votingMembers"``, which indicates all voting data-bearing nodes.

  This is not supported for server versions prior to 4.4 and will result in an
  exception at execution time if used.
