arg_name: option
name: autoEncryption
type: array
description: |
  Options to configure client-side field-level encryption in the driver. The
  encryption options are documented in the :php:`extension documentation
  <manual/en/mongodb-driver-manager.construct.php#mongodb-driver-manager.construct-driveroptions>`.
  For the ``keyVaultClient`` option, you may pass a :phpclass:`MongoDB\\Client`
  instance, which will be unwrapped to provide a :php:`MongoDB\\Driver\\Manager <class.mongodb-driver-manager>`
  to the extension.

arg_name: option
name: driver
type: array
description: |
  Additional driver metadata to be passed on to the server handshake. This is an
  array containing ``name``, ``version``, and ``platform`` fields:

  .. code-block:: php

     [
         'name' => 'my-driver',
         'version' => '1.2.3-dev',
         'platform' => 'some-platform',
     ]

  .. note::

     This feature is primarily designed for custom drivers and ODMs, which may
     want to identify themselves to the server for diagnostic purposes.
     Applications should use the ``appName`` URI option instead of driver
     metadata.

arg_name: option
name: typeMap
type: array
description: |
  Default :php:`type map
  <manual/en/mongodb.persistence.deserialization.php#mongodb.persistence.typemaps>`
  to apply to cursors, which determines how BSON documents are converted to PHP
  values. The |php-library| uses the following type map by default:

  .. code-block:: php

     [
         'array' => 'MongoDB\Model\BSONArray',
         'document' => 'MongoDB\Model\BSONDocument',
         'root' => 'MongoDB\Model\BSONDocument',
     ]
interface: phpmethod
operation: ~
optional: true

arg_name: option
name: allow_invalid_hostname
type: boolean
description: |
  Disables hostname validation if ``true``. Defaults to ``false``.

  Allowing invalid hostnames may expose the driver to a `man-in-the-middle
  attack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack>`_.

  Passphrase for the PEM encoded certificate (if applicable).

  Falls back to the deprecated ``passphrase`` SSL context option if not
